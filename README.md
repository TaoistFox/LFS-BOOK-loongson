LFS book hope to explore the loongson platform experiment, from the source code package to compile build a Linux system, stripping cocoon reel off raw silk from cocoons, analyzes the key technology of the need to pay attention to with the original compilation chain, temporary compile compile chain relationship of chain, purpose, and to make the difference between the LFS x86 platform, there will be marked, and interpretation of the practical application. Throughout the LFS - loongson test, as well as the design process, the author accumulated some practical experience, also through the book together to share out, hope to build from source to build a Linux system and loongson readers have help
